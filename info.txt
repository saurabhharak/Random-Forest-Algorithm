# Random-Forest-Algorithm
I used the random forest algorithm to find the bank note authentication in this project. In this case, I used Photos of genuine and forged banknote-like specimens were used to obtain information. An industrial camera, usually used for print inspection, was used for digitization. The final images have a resolution of 400x400 pixels. Gray-scale picturing is possible due to the object lens and distance to the examined object. It was possible to obtain images with a resolution of about 660 dpi. To extract features from images, the Wavelet Transform method was used.

The project's frontend was built with Flask, and it was deployed on Heroku.
The requirements.txt file includes all of the dependencies.
Run App.py after all dependencies have been installed.
